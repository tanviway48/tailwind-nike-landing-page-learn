## 🙌 Credits

 
Original tutorial:[Javascript Mastery](https://youtu.be/tS7upsfuxmo?si=vUruCw_5n0PKv82E)

I recreated the project from scratch to learn the concepts and wrote all the code myself during the process.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add a dark mode toggle 🌙
- Add scroll-based animations using AOS or Framer Motion
- Convert layout to a React/Next.js version
- Refactor with reusable Tailwind components

## 🧠 Reflection

> *"Following this tutorial gave me confidence to build UIs on my own using Tailwind. My next step is to build a unique landing page without any tutorial — purely from a wireframe or Figma mockup."*
